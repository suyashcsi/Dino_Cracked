When there is no internet connection available, Google Chrome web browser on Windows and macOS
 (most likely on Linux too) shows up a page detailing the possible causes as well as a small endless runner game
 with a dinosaur that has to run, dodge obstacles and accumulate points. The game is relatively simple-minded.
 A monochrome game area with clouds, cacti, bumps in the ground, a dinosaur, a Hi-Score counter and a current score counter. 
As levels increase in complexity, the dinosaur will have to dodge cacti, pterodactyls, and so on. 
The game also inverts the contrast at random points making the 
background black and the creatures white to simulate a night mode and at the same time to draw playerâ€™s
 attention to the background change making it harder to play for a second, which could prove fatal.
